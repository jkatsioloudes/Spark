# Spark

## Who is Who
Spark is an online forum for two types of people: Part time or unemployed developers and non technical people with ideas or mini tech problems.  Developers can get inspired and hone their problem solving skills, understand what is trending and more importantly get iterative feedback from stakeholders.  Non technical people are often missing the expertise and skillset to proceed with their idea or problem.  Often, they don’t have the time or energy to practise and learn new skills so we provide them with the capability of posting in this forum and find one or many interested developers.

## Motivation
The website has 2 main usages.  Firstly, part time or unemployed developers can see what is trending and get inspiration about problems for which they can implement computerised solutions.  Secondly and maybe more importantly they can now get iterative feedback coming from the interested audience towards what they are building.

Non technical people have not the expertise and skills to address their tech problems themselves.  Almost always they don’t have the time to gain these skills so they can post this type of problems to developers and provide them with all they need in order to produce the best possible result.

Most importantly, what Spark want to do is not to create (another) database full of posts that no one pays attention to, but it tries to bridge this communication gap between the two aforementioned parties of the target audience.  We can achieve this by building an internal way to provide iterative feedback to developers and the opposite, give the chance to the potential end user to try the app.

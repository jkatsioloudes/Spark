Spark is a social network for primarily 2 types of people: Part time or unemployed developers and non technical people.

Developers can get inspiration on which problems can address technology into, see what is trending, but more importantly to get iterative feedback from the interested audience towards what they are building.

Non technical people have not the expertise and skills to address the problems they have themselves.  Almost always they don’t have the time to gain these skills so they can post this type of problems to developers and provide them with all they need in order to produce the best possible result.

Most importantly, what Spark want to do is not to create (another) database full of posts that no one pays attention to, but it tries to bridge this communication gap between the two aforementioned parties of the target audience.  We can achieve this by building an internal way to provide iterative feedback to developers and the opposite, give the chance to the potential end user to try the app.

This project was implemented using Python’s framework Django and SQlite3 for databases for backend and HTML and CSS for the front end.
